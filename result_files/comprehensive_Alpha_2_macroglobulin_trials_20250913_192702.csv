NCT01613833,"Evaluation of Serum and Synovium Protease Inhibitor Levels in Primary and Secondary Osteoarthritic Joints, and Comparison for Patients Undergoing Joint Replacement",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01613833,SUSPENDED,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the irreversible degeneration of articular cartilage and underlying bone. It poses a major healthcare problem as it is the leading cause of joint disease and disability in the United States. It was traditionally thought that OA was a consequence of aging and joint trauma. However, it is now thought that OA is a result of the interplay of multiple genetic, biomechanical, and biochemical factors that disrupt the normal homeostasis of cartilage, bone, and synovium.
 
 OA is classified into two groups, primary and secondary. Primary OA is classically polyarticular and peripheral while secondary OA can commonly be attributed to a specific cause, limited to a singular joint, and a result of trauma. It is known as post-traumatic OA (PTOA). Other causes of secondary OA include congenital disorders, calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate deposition disease, and other diseases. Regardless of classification, genetic variation in the normal metabolism of cartilage and bone is thought to play a role in the progression of OA. Furthermore, the polyarticular presentation of primary idiopathic osteoarthritis suggests that it may have a stronger genetic component as compared to secondary OA, indicating a deviation from normal cartilage and bone homeostasis.
 
 Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their inhibitors take part in the metabolism of cartilage and bone. MMPs are enzymes that catalyze the degradation of elements within joint spaces while their inhibitors cease this activity. Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a naturally-occurring plasma glycoprotein that functions throughout multiple tissues and extracellular spaces as a protease inhibitor but does not normally reach high levels within the intra-articular joint space. A2M is believed to modulate the systemic inflammatory response by its ability to bait, trap, and clear various MMPs and cytokines. Concentrated A2M directly addresses the roles of cytokines and catabolic enzymes known to participate in the development of osteoarthritis. Cytonics has shown that A2M can inhibit cartilage degradation in vitro. As the role of MMPs and protease inhibitors have emerged as key components of OA, the investigation of regulators of MMP has become of interest to elucidate the pathogenesis and possible novel treatments of OA.
 
 This study aims to measure and correlate the levels of alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M) in plasma and knee joint OA between primary post-traumatic (PTOA) and secondary osteoarthritis groups.",Osteoarthritis of the Knee,PROCEDURE: Blood Draw|PROCEDURE: Joint Aspirate Harvest|PROCEDURE: Blood Draw|PROCEDURE: Joint Aspirate Harvest,"Scuderi, Gaetano J., M.D.",,,OBSERVATIONAL,2012-03-31,2018-08-31,40,2018-08-31,N/A,Alpha-2-macroglobulin,Database + Manual
NCT02210468,"A Phase I/II, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Safety and Efficacy Study to Evaluate APIC-CF Therapy for Mild to Moderate Primary Osteoarthritis of the Knee",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02210468,UNKNOWN,"The mechanism of Osteoarthritis (OA) is complex, however the investigators know that cartilage breakdown follows changes in certain cells in the cartilage called chondrocytes, leading to proteases that break down cartilage. There is a protein in the human blood called alpha-2-macroglobulin that can trap these proteases and prevent the breakdown of cartilage. Cytonics developed a device that use the patient's own blood to remove all cells and concentrate alpha-2-macroglobulin to be injected in the painful knee due to osteoarthritis.",Pain|Osteoarthritis,"DEVICE: APIC-CF, 4 cc|DEVICE: APIC-CF, 2 cc|OTHER: Placebo Comparator: Saline",Cytonics Corporation,,PHASE1/PHASE2,INTERVENTIONAL,2015-05-31,2016-12-31,300,2016-07-31,N/A,Alpha-2-macroglobulin,Database + Manual
NCT03307876,Intradiscal Injection of an Autologous Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) Concentrate Alleviates Back Pain in FAC-positive Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03307876,COMPLETED,"A cartilage degradation product, the Fibronectin-Aggrecan complex (FAC), has been identified in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD). Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) can prevent the formation of the G3 domain of aggrecan, reducing the fibronectin-aggrecan G3 complex and therefore may be an efficacious treatment. The present study was designed to determine 1) the ability of autologous concentrated A2M to relieve back pain in patients with LBP from DDD and 2) the ability of FAC to predict the response to this biologic therapy.
 
 24 patients with low back pain and MRI-concordant DDD had prospective evaluation. Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scores (VAS) were noted at baseline and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Primary outcome of clinical improvement was defined as patients with both a decrease in VAS of at least 3 points and ODI \>20 points. Molecular discography and delayed FAC analysis and injection of platelet poor plasma at the time of the procedure. Patients with FACT-positive assays were significantly more likely to show improvement in their VAS and ODI at follow-up.",Low Back Pain,OTHER: autologous PPP injection,"Scuderi, Gaetano J., M.D.",,,OBSERVATIONAL,2014-04-30,2015-05-31,24,2015-05-31,N/A,Alpha-2-macroglobulin,Database + Manual

Compare to classical histology, molecular assessment of renal tissue offers unbiased and technically robust approach. In this prospective 3-months' observational study procurement biopsies in 180 brain death donors will be performed. Using microarray which detect top differently regulated genes, conventional histology, urinary AKI biomarkers, renal function and clinical variables models predicting DGF and early graft scarring (IFTA, poor graft function) in recipients will be constructed. The associations of AKI in donors with distinct fibrosis atrophy and AKI molecular signals will be found. Molecular techniques and final models may help to improve the decision-making process for the acceptance of kidneys from marginal donors but more importantly, it may help clinicians to guide less toxic immunosuppression in identified problematic grafts.",Kidney Transplantation|Acute Kidney Injury,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Urine Biomarkers|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Gene expression profiling of donor kidneys by microarray|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Gene expression profiling of recipient kidneys by microarray,Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine,,,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Alpha-2-macroglobulin,Manual Only
NCT06263270,"Evaluation of CYT-108, a Recombinant Protease Inhibitor, for Treatment of Mild to Moderate Primary Osteoarthritis of the Knee",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06263270,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The goal of this Phase 1 study is to investigate the safety of CYT-108, our experimental recombinant protease inhibitor drug candidate for osteoarthritis, in a population of patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. The main questions this study aims to answer are:
 
 1. are two doses of CYT-108, delivered 12 weeks apart, safe when injected directly into the joint?
 2. does administration of CYT-108 result in a reduction in pain, stiffness, and improvement in daily physical function?
 
 Participants will either receive a placebo (Phosphate Buffer Saline, PBS) or CYT-108, and will be asked to report their pain/stiffness at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 26 (in a physician's office) after the initial injection, using a questionnaire to be provided by the physician. In addition to reporting the magnitude of pain, participants will also be asked about the onset of pain reduction. Researchers will compare the pain/stiffness scores between the CYT-108-treated to placebo-treated groups along the 26 week duration of the study. Participants will also receive blood draws along the course of the study, and researchers will analyze this blood for the presence of cartilage degradation product in attempt to identify ""disease modification"" (i.e., a reduction in cartilage degradation) in response to CYT-108 treatment.","Osteoarthritis, Knee|Osteoarthritis","BIOLOGICAL: CYT-108, a recombinant protease inhibitor|OTHER: Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)",Cytonics Corporation,Southern Star Research,PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Alpha-2-macroglobulin,Manual Only
